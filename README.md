# Image Captioning Using a Transformer Network & Attention of Spatial Prepositions
Implementation of transformer network for image captioning. Exploration of the attention of spatial prepositions.

# Setup

In ```resources/```folder download the Flickr30k dataset, which I found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset).

I originally implemented the dataloader using Flickr8k which has a slightly different structure. In ```data_loader.ipynb``` you will find a short script that converts the csv of flickr30k to the same structure as that of Flickr8k.

# Model and Attention Analysis.
